#  Optimization of a City Transportation Network (Minimum Spanning Tree)

##  Overview
This project models a city’s transportation network as a **weighted undirected graph**, where:
- **Vertices** represent city districts.  
- **Edges** represent potential roads between districts.  
- **Edge weights** represent construction costs.

The objective is to determine the **minimum-cost network** that connects all districts, using:
- **Prim’s Algorithm**
- **Kruskal’s Algorithm**

Both algorithms are implemented, analyzed, and compared in terms of:
- MST total cost  
- Execution time  
- Number of algorithmic operations (comparisons, unions, etc.)  



##  Objectives
1. Implement Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms to compute the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**.
2. Read graph data from **JSON input files** and write results to **JSON output files**.
3. Compare algorithm performance on graphs of different sizes and densities.
4. Produce analytical results and conclusions on efficiency and scalability.
